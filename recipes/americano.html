    <p> <h2> What is an <em>"Americano"</em> ? </h2> </p>

    <p>An Americano is an espresso drink
    made with hot water and espresso, also called a Caffe
    Americano. The drink can be made with either one or 
    two shots of espresso, and varying ratios of water.
    Diluting the strong dark espresso roast brings the 
    flavor closer to a drip coffee.</p>

    <p> A true Americano does not include milk like a latte, 
    cappuccino, or macchiato. You can add milk if you like, 
    but then it’s not the true form of this drink.  </p>

    <p> <strong>The typical Caffe Americano ratio is 2:1.</strong>
    That’s 2 parts hot water to 1 part espresso.
    This ratio makes the drink still taste dark and bitter,
    like a lightened form of espresso.</p>

    <p>You can customize the
    water in an American to taste. Every barista and coffee
    shop makes an Americano differently.</p>

    <p><strong>Use 3:1 for a smoother, milder coffee with more volume.</strong>
    This ratio makes the Americano taste like a bitter drip 
    coffee.</p>

    <p> <h2> Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coffee Bean (for Espresso)</li>
        <li>Espresso</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    
    <ol>
    
        <li> <strong>Espresso roast coffee:</strong>
    This is important to get the right dark, bitter flavor.
    Espresso roast is simply very, very dark roast coffee.</li>
    
    <li>Make the Espresso via Espresso machine, espresso maker,
    or Aeropress. This recipe uses Espresso machine.

    </li>
    
    <li> <strong>Boil the water.</strong>
    Use a regular or electric teapot to boil the water.
    The standard ratio is <strong>2:1</strong> water to espresso, but you
    can go up to as much as <strong>3:1</strong>.
    <p><strong>Tips: Decide on your drink size. </strong>A 1-shot Americano 
    can mostly fit in an espresso mug (shown here). A 2-shot
    drink is best suited in a latte mug. </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mix the two and enjoy!</strong>
    Pour the boiling water into the espresso.
    Instant Caffe Americano!</li>
